# Welcome to the FastTrack Workshop repo!
This is the repository for the workshop on using FastTrack for the Phonetics lab meeting on 1st February, 2022. 

# Overview
Fast Track is (nearly) automated formant tracking tool that enables you to extract the formant contours quickly and easily. The tool functions as a plug-in in Praat, so there is no need for you to code anything. Fast Track is developed by Santiago Barreda at UC Davies and more information can be found here: https://github.com/santiagobarreda/FastTrack
